# JetLinks Reactive

Read [`references/reactive-practice.md`](references/reactive-practice.md) first.

## Workflow

1. Inspect adjacent code to confirm whether the target module is reactive or blocking.
2. If this is a new backend feature or large reactive behavior change, first follow [`../jetlinks-router/references/backend-design-test-driven-rules.md`](../jetlinks-router/references/backend-design-test-driven-rules.md): write the design draft and realistic test goals to the appropriate docs directory and wait for explicit user confirmation.
3. If the module is reactive, keep `Mono` or `Flux` end-to-end and avoid imperative fallbacks.
4. If blocking I/O is unavoidable, isolate it explicitly and only use the scheduler pattern already accepted by the codebase.
5. Combine this skill with `$jetlinks-crud`, `$jetlinks-boundary`, or `$jetlinks-events` when the task spans those scenarios.

## Required Constraints

- Do not call `block()` inside reactive business flows unless the current module already does so for the same boundary and there is no safer local alternative.
- Do not introduce nested `subscribe()` for core business control flow.
- Do not wrap blocking code in reactive types and claim the flow is non-blocking.
- Do not use `CompletableFuture.get(...)`, `Thread.sleep`, or busy-wait loops to coordinate with a reactive result; use `flatMap` / `zip` / `then` / `concatMap` / `Sinks` / events / commands instead.
- Do not bypass reactive context with global mutable `static` state or `ThreadLocal` to fake non-blocking propagation.
- Treat `Publisher` / `Subscriber` / `Subscription` demand, cancellation, and terminal signals as the official reactive boundary. A chain starts at an existing `Publisher` or the first real async I/O boundary, not at a local object.
- Operators must compose clearly named functions. Do not write procedural scripts inside a chain; each `map` / `filter` / `flatMap` / `zip` / `then` should express one semantic step.
- Keep operator chains minimal: avoid `Mono.just(...).map(...)`, adjacent `.map(...).map(...)` for one synchronous business step, `.flatMap(Mono::just)`, identity `map`, redundant `then(Mono.just(...))`, or adjacent `.filter().filter(...)` when the value can be computed before wrapping, synchronous steps can be composed into a named function, `thenReturn(...)` is clearer, or predicates can be combined / extracted.
- Do not start a chain with `Mono.just(request)` only to transform a local value before the first async boundary; compute the argument directly and call the reactive API, such as `repository.save(request.toEntity())`.
- Do not wrap pure synchronous helpers as `Mono` / `Flux`. Data conversion, field calculation, predicate checks, and other non-I/O logic should remain plain methods and be called from `map`, `filter`, or before entering the chain.
- Do not call `collectList()` on unbounded or potentially large streams; only collect when the source is clearly bounded by page, limit, batch, protocol size, or validated input size. Prefer pagination, bounded `buffer` / `window`, streaming, or existing query-composition helpers.
- Keep lambdas as glue code. If a lambda contains validation plus query plus mutation plus side effect, nested branching, loops, `try/catch`, or multiple DB / remote calls, extract a named method and test that method through the reactive chain.
- When the reactive API or library does not satisfy the requirement (signature mismatch, missing extension point, serialization error inside the chain), follow [`../jetlinks-conventions/references/root-cause-and-no-hack-rules.md`](../jetlinks-conventions/references/root-cause-and-no-hack-rules.md): solve at the root via official extension points / adjacent abstractions / dependency choice, or inform the user with concrete trade-offs; do not use reflection / visibility hacks / copied source / silent `catch` to make the chain compile.
- Do not implement a large reactive change before the design draft, backpressure or batching expectations, failure behavior, and realistic test goals have been documented and confirmed.
- Do not make reactive tests pass by sleeping, swallowing errors, ignoring dropped signals, or weakening assertions; verify emitted values, completion or error signals, ordering, concurrency, retry, timeout, and side effects that match real usage.
- When reactive code changes are made, run relevant validation when possible; otherwise state the exact pending commands and residual blocking risks.

## Response Shape

1. Current module execution model
2. Reactive risks or blocking risks
3. Official reactive boundary, recommended chain, operator semantics, and batching / collection boundary
4. Design doc path and test goals when the backend design gate applies
5. Verification evidence or exact pending commands
